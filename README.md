> WebRTC based collaborative MermaidJS editor.

## Why?

I've recently found myself in multiple meetings editing diagram with multiple people as we work through a problem and felt the need for this. It's also a good opportunity to play with WebRTC and CRDTs.

Other options:

- There are multiple code based editor online but they don't support multiplayer so we're stuck watching one person write things down.
  E.g. [Mermaid's live editor](https://mermaid.live/edit#pako:eNpt0LFuAjEMBuBXMZ7DC9xAhcRQKnXqVmWxkv-4SElMQyKEEO9O7q5seLKc749k39mpBw98wV9DdjgEORVJNlOvfQwO293uS6c80CdiVJp7Q5NeSQropu3jnV2VkzwLmiCFEv7l_Lbtckn0b8OaNXRcAgvuqc1bfaQRiHQqkLphwwklSfB9g_vsLdcJCZaH3nqM0mK1bPOjU2lVf27Z8VBLg-F29lJfC7-G8KFq-V6PstzG8Fnyr2ono8QLHk-kw2Qy).
- We could use a VSCode remote session but that only works if everyone has it setup and the firewall plays nice.
- Many visual editors have multiplayer but I'd prefer editing in a text format for easy sharing, version tracking and inclusion in other tech docs later.
